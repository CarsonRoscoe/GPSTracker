# GPSTrackerWebApp

GPSTracker is a application/server/webapp combo created with the intention of gathering GPS data from mobile devices, sending it to a server and having that data be populated on a apache hosted webapp for users to view the data of themselves/other users at a later date.

GPSTracker is split into three componenets: The Java Android app, the C++ server and the PHP Apache hosted Webapp.

This is the repo for the PHP Apache hosted Webapp.

For the Android client & C++ server, see https://github.com/SpenserL/comp4985-gpstracker
